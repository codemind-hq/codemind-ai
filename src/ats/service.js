- required: named languages, frameworks, libraries, databases, platforms, tools and methods the posting requires or lists as what the person will work with.
- preferred: only the ones the posting itself marks as optional — nice to have, preferred, a plus, a bonus. When the posting marks no skill as optional, preferred is empty; a skill from a requirements sentence is required, however loosely it is worded.
- A category ("relational databases", "cloud platforms") is listed only when the posting names no specific product for it, and goes in the same list as the sentence it came from.
- One skill per item, 1-3 words, spelled as the posting spells it ("Node.js", "React Native", "CI/CD"). Split lists: "Jest and Cypress" is two items.
- Named things only. No soft skills, no years of experience, no degrees, no responsibilities ("mentoring", "code review"), no benefits.
- A skill appears once; if it is both required and preferred, it is required.
- items: every other requirement a candidate is judged on, most important first, at most 30:
  - experience: years or depth of experience, and domain or industry experience ("5+ years building backend services", "experience with payments or fintech").
  - responsibility: what the person will do, as it tests a candidate's past work ("design and run distributed systems in production", "lead a team of engineers"). A posting's duties and success metrics are requirements too: a candidate is judged on having done them, so they are not left out for its experience lines.
  - education: a degree, field of study or certification the posting asks for.
  Each one short statement, 4-15 words, in the posting's own words. priority is required unless the posting marks it optional (nice to have, preferred, a plus). Never a named skill on its own (those are the lists above), a soft skill (communication, teamwork, ownership), a benefit, or a fact about the company.`;

 * What a posting asks of a candidate, read from its description: the required and preferred
